# XSCHEM Device symbols for the Google-Skywater SKY130 Process Design Kit (pdk) 

This directory contains symbols to be used in the [XSCHEM](https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem)
schematic editor. For a quick XSCHEM introduction see this 
[presentation](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/xschem_man/tutorial_xschem_slides.html).<br>
These symbols represent the available silicon devices as documented on the 
[Skywater-pdk](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules/device-details.html) website
in the `device details` section.

## GOAL

Provide a set of symbols that can be used to draw circuit schematics in XSCHEM.
Netlists in various target formats can be extracted for simulation or Layout vs Schematic checks.
The set of symbols is designed to correctly link to the Skywater PDK model files, allowing to
seamlessly simulate the circuit with SPICE simulators.
